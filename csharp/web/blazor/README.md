# My summer love üíú

Recently I've been working with Blazor, and I have to say that I'm in love with it. It's a great way to develop web applications using C# and .NET, and it's a great way to develop web applications using C# and .NET.

I think that is a really GOOD update for the .NET ecosystem at the Web Component frameworks, because before this we only had ASP.NET WebForms (as a pure component-based framework), ASP.NET MVC (with the option to create components on a hard way (litterally 2 files inside its own component folder inside the componentS folder inside the shared folder inside the views folder) ) and I wouldn't want to count it but we can also add Silverlight(‚ò†Ô∏è) to the list.

I don't have too much experience with Blazor, so at this moment I didn't developed any snippet for it, but I'm planning to do it in the future. I hope you find something useful here.

 The only thing that I don't like about Blazor is the way that Microsoft is changing its directory architecture at every version and changing it's name from time to time

Literally we have:
- Blazor
- Blazor Server
- Blazor WebAssembly
- Blazor WebAssembly Hosted
- Blazor WebAssembly Standalone
- Blazor WebAssembly MAUI
- Blazor WebAssembly PWA Standalone Hosted With A Cherry On Top

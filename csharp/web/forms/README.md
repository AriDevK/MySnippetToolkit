Please don't judge me, I'm still using ASP WebForms because on my company we have a lot of legacy projects that are still using it. I know, I know... I should be using a modern framework, but I'm still using WebForms for some projects because is easy and fast to develop simple things.

Honestly, I'm not a big fan of WebForms, but I have to admit that it's a good way to start learning about web development. It's a good way to understand how the web works, and it's a good way to understand the basics of web development.

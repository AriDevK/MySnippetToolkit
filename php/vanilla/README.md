# Please don't say it loud, but I'm still using Vanilla PHP for some projects

I know, I know... I should be using a framework, but I'm still using Vanilla PHP for some projects. I'm not proud of it, but I'm not ashamed either. I'm just being honest with you.

Mainly I use it for my job, because we have a lot of legacy projects that weren't developed by the .NET team, and I have to maintain them.

Basically here you will find some small things that I made to avoid repeating code, or to make my life easier. I hope you find something useful here.
